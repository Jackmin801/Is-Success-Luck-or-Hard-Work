# Is-Success-Luck-or-Hard-Work
Analysis inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&amp;t
# Motivation
<p>Starting at 3:36 in the video, Derek (guy in the awesome CGP grey shirt) uses the NASA astronaut selection process as an example where 18300 applicants are competing for top 11 positions. He proposes a 95:5 ratio of skill score to luck score to obtain a total score of which only the top 11 would be successful. He concludes that the top 11 are very lucky, having an average luck score of 94.7% according to his simulation.</p>

<p>Intuitively, if the ratio of contribution to the final score was a 95:5 ratio, that should not change just because a higher consecutive subset was chosen in the distribution. To test this out, I decided to model his experiment using a normal distribution and an even distribution.</p>

<p>The conclusion is in the last cell of the notebeooks for those not interested in the code that generated the simulation.</p>

# Index
Experiment - Does the 95:5 contribution ratio of skill and luck hold for the top 11?
Experiment2 - How different would the selection be if there was no luck?
